    <div class="box" style="font-size: 25px;">The Sierra Madre, often referred to as the "backbone of Luzon," plays a critical role in the Philippines' ecological and disaster resilience. It serves as the country’s natural shield against typhoons, mitigates climate change through carbon sequestration, and supports rich biodiversity with 58% of the country's endemic plant species. <br> <br>
        <b>Current Issues: </b> <br> <br>
        <b>Deforestation: </b><br>
        Illegal logging and land clearing for agriculture and infrastructure are rapidly depleting the forest cover of Sierra Madre, which makes up about 40% of the Philippines’ total forests. This deforestation weakens its capacity to act as a natural barrier against typhoons and disrupts ecosystems <br> <br>

        <b>Infrastructure Projects:</b> <br>

        The Kaliwa Dam, a proposed government project aimed at addressing water shortages in Metro Manila, threatens to displace indigenous communities and destroy critical forest areas. Environmental groups argue it will exacerbate risks of flooding, landslides, and biodiversity loss <br> <br>

        <b>Advocacy and Conservation Efforts: </b> <br> <br>
        <b>Legislative Action:</b> <br> Proposals to establish the Sierra Madre Development Authority aim to strengthen conservation through better governance and resource management​ <br> <br>
        <b>Community Involvement: </b> <br>
        Indigenous groups, environmental advocates, and youth-led campaigns are driving awareness about the importance of protecting Sierra Madre. Activities include reforestation, educational outreach, and lobbying for stricter anti-logging laws.​ <br> <br>
        As a student, witnessing the ongoing deforestation in the Sierra Madre raises significant concerns about its environmental and social impact. The Sierra Madre is crucial for mitigating typhoon damage, maintaining biodiversity, and supporting local communities. Its degradation through illegal logging and large-scale projects like the Kaliwa Dam threatens these essential functions. <br> <br>
